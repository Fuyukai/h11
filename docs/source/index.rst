h11: A pure-Python HTTP/1.1 protocol library
============================================

h11 is a HTTP/1.1 protocol library written in Python. Its unique
feature compared to Python's many other HTTP/1.1 libraries is that --
like `hyper-h2 <https://hyper-h2.readthedocs.io/>`_ -- it is written
in a bring-your-own-I/O style, ready to be integrated into any I/O
environment, be it blocking, threaded, async, or whatever.

todo:
- example / quickstart
- semantic docs, with state machine diagrams
  - figure out how to run the scripts to generate the state machine
    diagrams as part of the sphinx build
- API docs
